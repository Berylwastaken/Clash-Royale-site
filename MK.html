<h1>How to Counter Evo Mega Knight</h1>
    <p>Mega Knight may look scary at first, but it is actually quite easy to counter. The cheapest counter is to play any 1 elixir card in the middle,
      then place another just in front of your king tower. If done correctly, the Mega Knight will activate King Tower. Pekka is a very powerful 
      counter and will full counter wherever you place it. Evoloution Royal Ghost is another amazing counter. Every time Mega Knight knocks back, he 
    goes invisible again and spawns his helpers. Don't forget you can also counter with Valkyrie, Knight, and Mini Pekka.</p>

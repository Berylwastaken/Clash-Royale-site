  <h1>How To Counter Evo Royal Giant</h1>
    <p> While most cards can be shredded by tank killers like Mini Pekka, Pekka will usually one or two-shot these.
      Instead, you can use towers like the Inferno tower, which are great against
    tanks. Inferno dragon also works well. You will usually play a cheap card to tank on defense against this.
    Skarmy can work, but you have to watch out because many Pekka decks have Zap. The same applies to inferno.
      If he resets it with zap, play Skarmy or Goblin Gang.</p>

  <h1>How To Counter Evo Royal Giant</h1>
    <p>While base royal giant can be countered by Skarmy, evo is a different story. The recoil
      damage can kill skeletons. Instead, you can use towers like the Inferno tower, which are great against
    tanks. Inferno dragon plus cannon also works well. You almost always need a building to distract this card
    on defense.</p>
